  The following links are included:
  - **Home** (Currently Active)
  - **Blog**
  - **New** (Create Post)
  - **Profile**
  - **Logout**
  - **Search Bar** (For quick search functionality)
    - User can search for posts by entering a keyword in the search bar. The search function looks for matches in the title, summary, content, and category of posts.

         - If no keyword is entered, all posts will be shown.

   - The menu is hidden by default and appears when the hamburger icon is clicked.
   - It includes links to Home, Blog, New, Register, and Login for easy access.
   - A search bar is placed below the menu, allowing users to quickly find content.

# Bug-Issue
## ISSUE #1 Deployment and Debugging Issues (Heroku, Cloudinary, and django-allauth)
### During the project setup and development, the following issues and resolutions were encountered:

Image Not Found (404 Error) in Admin Panel
After the initial setup, images were not loading in the admin panel, resulting in a 404 error. Updating the django-allauth and Django versions resolved this issue.

### 500 Error on Heroku After Modifying account.html

Locally, with DEBUG = True in settings.py, the application worked as expected.
However, deploying the changes to Heroku with DEBUG = False resulted in a 500 error. No error trace was visible in the terminal logs.
After updating django and django-allauth once again, the 500 error was resolved on Heroku.
Cloudinary Configuration Issue
A missing configuration in models.py related to Cloudinary was causing errors. Adding the correct command in models.py fixed the issue.
+from cloudinary_storage.storage import MediaCloudinaryStorage, +storage=MediaCloudinaryStorage(), =class BlogPost

## ISSUE #2
After upgrading texteditor reachtexteditor was changed to simple texteditor, so I lefted 4.14.0 with allert message.

## ADVISE 
By advise in #peer-code-review in **Slack** changed Like button for a fivicon. ![Image](static/images/README/Screenshot%202025-03-04%20093035.png)

# Addition 

If a user tries to access the profile link with an account number (e.g., https://green-wisdom-99e0528945fb.herokuapp.com/profiles/user/1/) without logging in, they will encounter a 500 error. If they attempt to access the link without specifying an account number (e.g., https://green-wisdom-99e0528945fb.herokuapp.com/profiles/user/), they will be redirected to a 404 customer error page.
